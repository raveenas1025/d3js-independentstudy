# Entry 7
## What To Do? (Cont.)

This week consisted of searching for different types of React.js animations that I can incorporate into Book-o-mmender. Through various Google searches and saving links from different websites I was able to create a list of possible animations and widgets (which are the basic building blocks for User Interfaces) that I can code into Book-o-mmender.

#### <a href="http://reactkungfu.com/"> React Kung Fu </a>

This website was actually really helpful in learning more about React.js. The writer, Robert Pankowecki, is a Rails developer and in this article he speaks a lot on React.js. At the home page, he gives summaries of each of his articles and directs links towards the full article. There I learned a lot about JSX tags and using jQuery alongside React.js. One of the things that was extremely helpful was that Pankowecki spoke a lot about using both Ruby and React.js and using React.js with external APIs. This was helpful because the Book-o-mmender did use a Goodreads API and was coded in Ruby. Therefore, with the information given in this article I would be able to learn how to incorporate React.js within Book-o-mmender.

Through further exploring Pankowecki’s page, I found <a href="http://reactkungfu.com/react-by-example/"> React.js By Example </a> , which was an article on a book written that provided many examples of User Interfaces using React.js. This book contains multiple examples of such User Interfaces, unfortunately I was not going to purchase the book. Luckily, they did provide a sample chapter which listed twelve different Widgets.

On the left side of the sample page, there is a list of the twelve Widgets that could be created using React.js. Many of them stood out to me but I struggled to find out how I would use one of these Book-o-mmender. Thus, I created a list of possible ways I could use it.

#### Possible Ideas for Book-o-mmender:
<a href=”http://reactkungfu.com/showcases/password-strength-meter/”> Password Strength Meter </a>

If users wanted to create an account in order to save/purchase a book, then this meter would be helpful

Pros: Users would have their own account

Cons: I have to learn to code a way to have Users create an accounts.

When users create their account, they would be able to type in their location and then find a bookstore that is closer to them, based off of what books Book-o-mmender recommends.

Pros: Users would be given locations of stores near their area.

Cons: I would have to learn to code both an account form and then I could add on using the password strengthener meter.

<a href=”http://reactkungfu.com/showcases/filtering-list/”> Filtering List </a>

Users who don’t have a specific book to search could possibly use a filter for users to choose a genre or author they would like to specifically search a book from.

Pros: Users are given more things to use in Book-o-mmender when searching books

Cons: Finding the hash that would give out the genres and incorporating the filtering list within that.

<a href=”http://reactkungfu.com/showcases/preventive-button/”> Preventive Button </a>

When users press the search button they won’t be able to continuously click on it. Also when users create an account the submit button would be inactive when users already clicked it once.

Pros: Prevents users from clicking the search button multiple times, helping with the already slow loading that occurs when the API is running.

Cons: um

Now that was only four out of the twelve examples given. I could already tell that in order for most of what I want to do to actually work is by creating a form. 

I guess this is when I think of whether I truly want to work on Book-o-mmender. I know deep down it is something I want to add improvements on. For now, to be on the safe side, I'll be trying to incorporating some of my ideas into Book-o-mmender.

#### Takeaways:

Make a list. Creating a list of all of the ideas I have using React was super helpful as I was able to visualize which ideas are actually do-able and which would require more time.

Save links. What was really helpful for me was saving links of pages that had useful information on React. Some links offered articles on what React is for. Those articles reminded me of why I chose React in the first place. Other links had example with code of the capabilities of React which also helped me bc by looking at the code I was able to see how much I have learned as I was able to successfully read and understand many lines of code from those examples.
