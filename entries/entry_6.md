# Entry 6:
## What To Do?

This week was an interesting week. I realized that there was a reason for this independent study. Most of the time I stressed over what I was learning and whether I was memorizing the important things of JSX and its expressions. However, I failed to remember that the goal for this study was to actually create something practical. This week I spent time looking at all that I have learned about React and JSX and figuring out what types of front-end things that I can do with it.

#### Website?

I thought of creating a website with React. I knew that React was used in order to create Facebook and Instagram. Thus, I thought of creating a website that could be used for individuals in a creative and practical way. However, as days went by I couldn’t necessarily think of anything that was completely original. I didn’t just want to make something that was just another smaller and similar version of Facebook or Instagram. I wanted a spark to hit me and for me to find something that I can say, “Hey, that was all me”. 

I know that at one point I’ll probably be making something that was inspired by something else. However, right now I just want to be hit with inspiration that came from me and from past projects I have already done. It’s hard but maybe with more practice using React I’ll think of something.

I’ve had a couple of small ideas but I just feel like they’re necessarily practical or useful in any means. They’re more for fun and creativity purposes. But maybe I’ll end up using one of those ideas because I don’t know if I’ll find something practical or useful. Who knows, maybe creativity is where my independent study will come to use.

#### Book-o-mmender

Looking back at past projects, [http://book-o-mmender.herokuapp.com/](Book-o-mmender) is probably that one I am most proud of. It is something that I find both creative and practical. This website could be made better with React. There could be faster, efficient and prettier things that could be done to the website. It could have fading effect when the user goes to a different page. The ratings sections could have stars and user interaction such as being able to rate a specific book.

If no other ideas come to play, then improving on Book-o-mmender may be what React will be used for. I’m not giving up hope for a new idea but it’s always good to have a backup plan. For all you know, your backup plan could have been the plan you’ve been thinking of all along. That spark just hasn’t hit you yet.

#### Takeaways

Brainstorm. Don’t forget the original plan for this independent study. Yes, learning a new topic is always fun and interesting. But do brainstorm on what you can create with this topic. Creating something is just another helpful way in learning a new topic.

Don’t give up on an idea. I’ve had many, probably useless, ideas for my topic. But I haven’t thrown such ideas away because, who knows, maybe in the future weeks I’ll find a way to make it useful. Don’t cross out all your ideas, especially if it’s your only idea. Spend time on it and come back to it later if it gets to frustrating.
