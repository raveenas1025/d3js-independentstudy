# Entry 1: Introduction
## D3.js: Data Driven Documents
To begin, it took a week of exploring topics to finally find a possible topic that I want to indulge in for the next couple of weeks. Through browsing topics all I have really understood about myself is that I wanted to do something that is front-end and not related to Ruby. Furthermore, I want to be able to visualize the things that I code. Alongside that, I have prior knowledge of HTML and CSS, and I have also delved into Javascript.

D3.js was one of the choices I have picked out from the list of topics that provided both Ruby related and Non-Ruby related topics to study. I spent the week choosing between sigma.js and react.js but I found myself completely immersed in the [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) webpage. The way they displayed the many examples of past projects that used D3 was something I found myself completely hooked on.

## The Basics of What I've Learned
##### "D3.js is a JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data." ([D3.js](https://d3js.org/)).
It uses HTML, SVG, and CSS. Alongside that, it combines DOM manipulation and visual components to showcase its use for browsers.

It allows a person to create modern browsers without having to feel trapped under a single framework. Therefore, it allows for flexibility.

It can support large datasets and various types of animation and interactions without slowing down its speed.

- Mike Bostock is the creator of D3.js
    - Click [here](https://bost.ocks.org/mike/) to explore his website.
- Bostock's web page displays the uses of D3.js and the ways in which it displays data in a way that is pleasing for the eyes. He showcases multiple topics that can use D3 to portray its data. Such topics being politics, weather, maps, art (algorithms), sports and even simple graphs and shapes.

Through the research I have conducted, I have remembered the useful resource that is [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/). As D3.js utilizes the DOM, SVG and HTML, W3schools was a great resource in finding the basics and tutorials of these topics. Therefore, here it was I learned from W3schools and other resources found on Google.
#### Document Object Model (DOM)
- DOM is a standard for accessing documents.
- It is a platform and language-neutral interface that lets programs and scripts to access and update the content, structure and style of whatever document it accessed.
- D3 takes in random data and joins it together to a DOM. Therefore, it can then apply data-driven transformations into the document.
#### Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)
-  SVG defines vector-based graphics
-  It defines the graphics that are represented in XML. XML stands for eXtensible Markup Language and is mainly used to distribute data.
-  With SVG, any element attribute that exists in the files can be animated.
-  SVG can be combined with DOM.
#### Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML)
- It is the standard markup language used in order to create web pages.
#### Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
- Describes how HTML elements are being displayed on a screen.

## Take Aways
- One thing I am sure of after browsing topics is that I want to do something that is visual.
- This may not be the topic I stick with for the next weeks, but it is something that I definitely find myself learning in the future.
- I find myself feeling comfortable with the idea of having prior knowledge of both CSS and HTML because I can effectively read and understand SVG because of the similarities it holds.
- W3schools is a site that is extremely helpful in learning the bare basics of any topics. Therefore, I know I can learn DOM and SVG through the use of W3schools.
